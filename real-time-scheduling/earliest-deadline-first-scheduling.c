/*
Algorithm: Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduling

1. Start.
2. Read the number of tasks.
3. For each task, input:
      a) Process ID
      b) Burst Time
      c) Relative Deadline
      d) Period
4. Read the total scheduling time.
5. At every time unit:
      a) Release new task instances when the current time is a multiple of the task period.
      b) Assign a new absolute deadline to released tasks.
6. Among all ready tasks, select the task with the earliest deadline.
7. If two tasks have the same deadline, select the task with the smaller Process ID.
8. Execute the selected task for one time unit.
9. Decrease its remaining burst time.
10. If no task is ready, keep the CPU idle.
11. Repeat until the total scheduling time is completed.
12. Display the task executed at each time unit.
13. Stop.
